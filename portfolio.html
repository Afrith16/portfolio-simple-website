      <p class="p__descr">Hello! My name is Haru Afrith.k, and I am currently pursuing my studies in the IT department at mailam college. I have a keen interest in technology and software development, which has led me to enroll in a full-stack web development course through various YouTube channels. This course has significantly enriched my knowledge and skills in web development, covering both front-end and back-end technologies.In addition to my coursework, I enjoy exploring new programming languages and frameworks to enhance my skill set. I believe that continuous learning is essential in the ever-evolving tech industry. My goal is to apply my knowledge in a professional setting, and I am hopeful that my efforts will lead to a placement in a multinational corporation (MNC) after I complete my studies.Outside of academics, I enjoy [cricket,football], which helps me maintain a balanced lifestyle. I am excited about the future and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead!</p>
